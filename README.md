## About
Curious explorer with a persistent drive for innovation in Science and Technology. I bring a solid academic foundation in Computer Science Engineering and a Master's in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. As a researcher, my journey has led me to dive into projects that span crafting intelligent 6G Communication solutions to leveraging Machine Learning models for real-world applications such as speaker identification and adaptive algorithms for innovative ambulance systems. With a toolkit that includes TensorFlow, PyTorch, and more, I thrive in collaborative environments, fostering interdisciplinary teamwork to create impactful solutions.
