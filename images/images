Insert the images. a one-bit beamforming codebook for
Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is designed for an indoor
environment. Each codeword in a codebook is a phase pattern
at RIS elements that reflects the signal to a desired angle. For
a specific reflection angle, those codewords are computed that
maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver (RX).
Since multiple codewords can maximize the SNR, an algorithm
to reduce the size of the codebook is proposed. This ensures that
the codebook does not contain repetitive codewords. In addition,
after the codebook design, the codeword selection procedure is
performed using an Autoencoder (AE) that minimizes the Bit
Error Rate (BER) at the receiver. The proposed method shows
promising results compared to existing techniques in terms of
BER with reduced codebook size.
